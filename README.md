This is an addons for Home Assistant allows to use Python `Prophet` library inside a container.

To do this, in the HA UI, go to `Settings` --> `Addons` --> `Addon Store`.

In the button with the 3 dots, select `Repositories` and add the url: `https://github.com/mgenrique/hassos_prophet_addon`

This will make the addon appear in the UI under HassOS Prophet Addons and you can install it.


This addon has been created as a solution to the installation limitations of the custom component [ESS Controller](https://github.com/mgenrique/ESS_ControllerHA) in Home Assistant OS.
